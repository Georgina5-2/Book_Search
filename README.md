The application allows the user to signup/login. The search book option can be accessed without logging in, but the user won't have the option to add a book to their profile.
Once the user has logged in, books can be saved by clicking on the "save this book!" button.
All saved books can be found in the "See your Books" section. A book can be removed from this list by clicking the "Delete this Book" button.
